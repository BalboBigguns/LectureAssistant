                            which depends on the number of vibrations per second produced by the vocal cords.

                            To make your speech more engaging, it is recommended to use a broad range of tones. This 
                            way, your lecture is perceived as more engaging and more interesting to listen to. To do so
                            consider modulating your tone of speech. The easiest way to do it can be achieved by showing more enthusiasm
                            while speaking. The correlation between enthusiastic, charismatic speech and high values of pitch dynamism has
                            been scientifically proven. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           The amount of pitch modulation in your voice can be measured as <b>Pitch Dynamic Quotient - PDQ</b>. This metric
                           shows how much your tone differs from its average in arbitrary intervals ({data.f0.frame_length / 1000}s).

                        <p>
                            Speed of talking is most often measured by counting words spoken in every minute. This <b>words per minute (wpm)
                            </b> unit is a very handy way to judge how fast somebody speaks.

                        <p>
                            The speed at which you talk has a huge influence on how the audience perceives you and your speech. Itâ€™s important 
                            therefore to understand your speaking rate and how to alter it depending on the type of speech you are delivering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To give you some reference, here is your score compared to speech rates considered most appropriate for different 
                            types of speeches:

                            Remember, there is no single best speaking rate. To choose the best one, you should consider what is the character 
                            of a lecture you want to give. If it is more like a recap or has a more presentational style, you should go for a bit 
                            faster pace, probably in conversational range. If, on the other hand, the nature of your lecture is explanatory and you 
                            expect the audience to struggle with understanding the topic, a slower pace may provide better results.

                            The next chart shows how fast was your speech on average around each second of the recording. These values are 
                            calculated based on past and future 5 seconds of speech at each instance of the recording. It means that you should 
                            not be concerned too much if peaks or troughs reach undesirable values. Do not be afraid to speed up or slow down when 
                            necessary but pay attention to the overall tempo. The total average may give you a hint about that. You should try to
                            aim for a green range of 130 to 170 wpm, alternatively landing in a yellow range if the content of your lecture demands
                            that.
