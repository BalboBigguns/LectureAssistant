                                    To make your speech more engaging, it is recommended to use a broad range of tones. This 
                                    way, your lecture is perceived as more engaging and more interesting to listen to. To do so
                                    consider modulating your tone of speech. The easiest way to do it can be achieved by showing more enthusiasm
                                    while speaking. The correlation between enthusiastic, charismatic speech and high values of pitch dynamism has
                                    been scientifically proven.

                                        Speed of talking is most often measured by counting words spoken in every minute. This <b>words per minute (wpm)

                                        Remember, there is no single best speaking rate. To choose the best one, you should consider what is the character 
                                        of a lecture you want to give. If it is more like a recap or has a more presentational style, you should go for a bit 
                                        faster pace, probably in conversational range. If, on the other hand, the nature of your lecture is explanatory and you 
                                        expect the audience to struggle with understanding the topic, a slower pace may provide better results.

                                    The next chart shows how fast was your speech on average around each second of the recording. These values are 
                                    calculated based on past and future 5 seconds of speech at each instance of the recording. It means that you should 
                                    not be concerned too much if peaks or troughs reach undesirable values. Do not be afraid to speed up or slow down when 
                                    necessary but pay attention to the overall tempo. The total average may give you a hint about that. You should try to
                                    aim for a green range of 130 to 170 wpm, alternatively landing in a yellow range if the content of your lecture demands
                                    that.

                                        To make sure the volume level is high enough (but not too high) and your words are clearly audible take a look at 
                                        the volume chart. The <b>LUFS</b> - <i>Loudness Unit Full Scale</i>, calculation has been applied to measure loudness.

                                        The scale shows how your recording volume level corresponds to standards used across the audio-related industry. To get 
                                        the best results, try to adjust the volume to match the green region (12 - 16 LUFS is the sweetspot). It is not necessary 
                                        to get your loudness perfectly but having it in red regions can affect your recording quality quite seriously so keep that 
                                        in mind.
